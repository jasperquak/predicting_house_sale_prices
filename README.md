# Predicting house sale prices

In this project, we'll predict house sale prices based on a set of house features (numerical and categorical), using the linear regression algorithm.

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data science with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/predicting_car_prices/blob/main/PredictingCarPrices.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and the file AmesHousing.tsv into the same folder.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib.pyplot
* sklearn.metrics
* sklearn.model_selection
* sklearn.linear_model
* sklearn.utils
